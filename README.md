small on-chain front-end for gnosis safe

[use it ‚Üù](https://ourzora.github.io/smol-safe/)

this allows for gnosis safe interactions without requiring any specific backend-servers etc. utilizing safe protocol kit and a web3 injected connector. it's especially useful for new chains that may not be fully integrated into the official gnosis safe UI or as a backup user interface. All signatures in this app are created on-chain.

contributions are welcome. to add a new chain that is not yet in gnosis-deploys, update the chains.ts file.
